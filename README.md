SNN6mA

(I) Datasets & Best model

Datasets A.thaliana and D.melanogaster are placed inside the folder 'data'. The SNN6mA model that has the best performance on A.thaliana is named as 'best_model_th'  
while 'best_model_me' stands for the best performance of SNN6mA on D.melanogaster. Both of models are placed in the folder 'model'.

(II) DataProcessing.py

This python file is used to encode the sequences.

(III)MyModel.py

The code of the model used in SNN6mA can be obtained in this python file.

(IV) ModelTraining.py

It is a python file which does the training process.
